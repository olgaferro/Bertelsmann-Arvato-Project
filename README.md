# === [Bertelmann/Arvato  Project] ===


# === INSTALLATION ===
The code contained in this repository was written in Python 3, and requires the following Python packages: 

numpy 
pandas as pd
matplotlib.pyplot 
sklearn.preprocessing





Next, you will analyze the problem through visualizations and data exploration to have a better understanding of what algorithms and features are appropriate for solving it.

You will then implement the algorithms and metrics of your choice, documenting the preprocessing, refinement, and post-processing steps along the way.

Afterward, you will collect results about your findings, visualize significant quantities, validate/justify your results, and make any concluding remarks about whether your implementation adequately solves the problem.

You can choose to: (i) construct a blog post (or another medium for a write-up) to document all of the steps from start to finish of your project, or (ii) deploy your results into a web application.


# === DESCRIPTION ===

--You will first define the problem you want to solve and investigate potential solutions.--
In this project we are going to  individuals whose can probabilities to become a new customers to  Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics. 


The goal of this project is to analyze demographics data for customers of a mail-order sales company in Germany, comparing it against demographics information for the general population. To approach this  is going to use  unsupervised learning techniques to perform customer segmentation, identifying the parts of the population that best describe the core customer base of the company. 


# === FILES PROVIDED FOR Bertelmann ARVATO ===

-- Files associated Demographics data  for--



AZDIAS:          the general population of Germany; 
CUSTOMERS:        customers of a mail-order company; 

-- Files associated Demographics data for individuals who were targets of a marketing campaign

MAILOUT_TRAIN
MAIOUT_TEST 

--  Attributes files

./DIAS Information Levels - Attributes 2017.xlsx) is a top-level list of attributes and descriptions, organized by informational category.
./DIAS Attributes - Values 2017.xlsx:is a detailed mapping of data values for each feature in alphabetical order.



## 1. PROJECT MOTIVATION

With these file information about population in Germany the goal is use a model to predict which individuals are most likely to become a future customers for the company.
